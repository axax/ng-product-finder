AngularJS product finder example
================================

This is a lightweight angularJS "product finder" example based on a CSV file. It consists only of three files: the view (index.html), the controller (app.js) and the data (products.csv). It demonstrates how to read a csv file and how to use its data to apply queries and filters.
